A-Star demonstration
====================
This program is aimed to show how A-Star algorithm works in practice and its all written in Java. 

Requirements
============
Java 1.5 or above to run.

Control
=======
Simply press space on your keyboard for more directions:
* left mouse for placing block.
* right mouse for removing block.
* 1 for start point.
* 2 for goal point.
* 3 for obstacle blocks.
* R for reset the map.
* P toggle displaying the path.
* enter for starting path-finding.

Known Issues
============
On Mac you can drag the cursor to draw blocks, but on Windows sorry you can't :( 
Due to the difference of implementing mouse draging method on different platform,
and I am too lazy to fix it. ^_^
